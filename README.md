SKMMG
===

This is a multiplayer game that I am making.

Building
---

**IDE:**  
SKMMG uses [CodeLite](http://codelite.org/) as its main IDE. Once installed, just open the repository as a workspace. The client and server are included as separate projects.

**Recommended Compiler:**  
- [MinGW-w64](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/) for Windows

**Other:**  
[OGRE 1.8.1](http://www.ogre3d.org/) is required to build and run SKMMG. There is no prebuilt sdk for MinGW-w64 available, so OGRE must be built manually. [Step-by-step guide](http://www.ogre3d.org/tikiwiki/tiki-index.php?page=Building+Ogre+with+boost+1.50+upwards+and+MinGW)
